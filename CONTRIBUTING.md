## Guidelines
### Adding RPC Messages
When you add new RPC message, it's recommended to follow raw PB message case, for example
`RegisterWorker` and `RegisterWorkerResponse`. The RPC messages will be unified into raw PB messages eventually.

### Using `repeated` instead of `map` type field of RPC Messages
When adding fields to an RPC Message, use `repeated` instead of `map` type. `TransportMessages` contains static code blocks to initialize many `Descriptor`s and `FieldAccessorTable`s, where the instantiation of `FieldAccessorTable` includes reflection.

### Using Error Prone
Error Prone is a static analysis tool for Java that catches common programming mistakes at compile-time.

To add the Error Prone plugin in IntelliJ IDEA, start the IDE and find the Plugins dialog. Browse Repositories, choose Category: Build, and find the Error-prone plugin. Right-click and choose 'Download and install'. The IDE will restart after youâ€™ve exited these dialogs.

Allows to build projects using Error Prone Java compiler to catch common Java mistakes at compile-time. To use the compiler, go to 'File | Settings/Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler | Java Compiler' and select 'Javac with error-prone' in 'Use compiler' box.

### Introduce And Bump Dependencies
When introducing a new dependency or bumping version of a dependency, you need to keep the dependency consistent with its LICENSE in LICENSE-binary to avoid missing the LICENSE of the dependency.
