# JVM Profiler
Since version 0.5.0, Celeborn supports JVM sampling profiler to capture CPU and memory profiles. This article provides a detailed guide of Celeborn `Worker`'s code profiling.

## Worker Code Profiling
The JVM profiler enables code profiling of workers based on the [async profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/blob/v4.0/README.md), a low overhead sampling profiler.
This allows a `Worker` instance to capture CPU and memory profiles for `Worker` which is later analyzed for performance issues. 
The profiler captures [Java Flight Recorder (jfr)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/es-es/red_hat_build_of_openjdk/17/html/using_jdk_flight_recorder_with_red_hat_build_of_openjdk/openjdk-flight-recorded-overview) files for each worker that can be read by tools like Java Mission Control and Intellij etc.
The profiler writes the jfr files to the `Worker`'s working directory in the `Worker`'s local file system and the files can grow to be large,
so it is advisable that the `Worker` machines have adequate storage.

Code profiling is currently only supported for

*   Linux (x64)
*   Linux (arm64)
*   Linux (musl, x64)
*   MacOS

To get maximum profiling information set the following jvm options for the `Worker` :

```
-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints -XX:+PreserveFramePointer
```

For more information on async_profiler see the [Async Profiler Manual](https://krzysztofslusarski.github.io/2022/12/12/async-manual.html).

To enable code profiling, enable the code profiling in the configuration.

```properties
celeborn.worker.jvmProfiler.enabled true
```

For more configuration of code profiling refer to `celeborn.worker.jvmProfiler.*`.

### Profiling Configuration Example
```properties
celeborn.worker.jvmProfiler.enabled true
celeborn.worker.jvmProfiler.options event=wall,interval=10ms,alloc=2m,lock=10ms,chunktime=300s
```
