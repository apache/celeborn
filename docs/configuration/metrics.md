| Key | Default | isDynamic | Description | Since | Deprecated |
| --- | ------- | --------- | ----------- | ----- | ---------- |
| celeborn.metrics.capacity | 4096 | false | The maximum number of metrics which a source can use to generate output strings. | 0.2.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.collectPerfCritical.enabled | false | false | It controls whether to collect metrics which may affect performance. When enable, Celeborn collects them. | 0.2.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.conf | &lt;undefined&gt; | false | Custom metrics configuration file path. Default use `metrics.properties` in classpath. | 0.3.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.enabled | true | false | When true, enable metrics system. | 0.2.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.extraLabels |  | false | If default metric labels are not enough, extra metric labels can be customized. Labels' pattern is: `<label1_key>=<label1_value>[,<label2_key>=<label2_value>]*`; e.g. `env=prod,version=1` | 0.3.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.json.path | /metrics/json | false | URI context path of json metrics HTTP server. | 0.4.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.json.pretty.enabled | true | false | When true, view metrics in json pretty format | 0.4.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.prometheus.path | /metrics/prometheus | false | URI context path of prometheus metrics HTTP server. | 0.4.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.sample.rate | 1.0 | false | It controls if Celeborn collect timer metrics for some operations. Its value should be in [0.0, 1.0]. | 0.2.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.timer.slidingWindow.size | 4096 | false | The sliding window size of timer metric. | 0.2.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.worker.app.topResourceConsumption.bytesWrittenThreshold | 0b | false | Threshold of bytes written for top resource consumption applications list of worker. The application which has bytes written less than this threshold will not be included in the top resource consumption list, including diskBytesWritten and hdfsBytesWritten. | 0.6.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.worker.app.topResourceConsumption.count | 0 | false | Size for top items about top resource consumption applications list of worker. The top resource consumption is determined by sum of diskBytesWritten and hdfsBytesWritten. The top resource consumption count prevents the total number of metrics from exceeding the metrics capacity. Note: This will add applicationId as label which is considered as a high cardinality label, be careful enabling it on metrics systems that are not optimized for high cardinality columns. | 0.6.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.worker.appLevel.enabled | true | false | When true, enable worker application level metrics. Note: applicationId is considered as a high cardinality label, be careful enabling it on metrics systems that are not optimized for high cardinality columns. | 0.6.0 |  | 
| celeborn.metrics.worker.pauseSpentTime.forceAppend.threshold | 10 | false | Force append worker pause spent time even if worker still in pause serving state. Help user can find worker pause spent time increase, when worker always been pause state. |  |  |
