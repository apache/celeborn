| celeborn.worker.sortPartition.prefetch.enabled | true | false | When true, partition sorter will prefetch the original partition files to page cache and reserve memory configured by `celeborn.worker.sortPartition.reservedMemoryPerPartition` to allocate a block of memory for prefetching while sorting a shuffle file off-heap with page cache for non-hdfs files.

| celeborn.worker.storage.dirs | &lt;undefined&gt; | false | Directory list to store shuffle data. It's recommended to configure one directory on each disk. Storage size limit can be set for each directory. For the sake of performance, there should be no more than 2 flush threads on the same disk partition if you are using HDD, and should be 8 or more flush threads on the same disk partition if you are using SSD. For example: `dir1[:capacity=][:disktype=][:flushthread=],dir2[:capacity=][:disktype=][:flushthread=]` | 0.2.0 |  | 
| celeborn.worker.storage.disk.reserve.ratio | &lt;undefined&gt; | false | Celeborn worker reserved ratio for each disk. The minimum usable size for each disk is the max space between the reserved space and the space calculate via reserved ratio. | 0.3.2 |  |
